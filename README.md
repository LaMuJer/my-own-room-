# Three Js 3d Modeling

<p>After learning <a href='https://threejs-journey.com/'>ThreeJs Journey by Bruno Simon</a> , this is my first project.</p>
<p><b><i>Gsap, Vite, ThreeJs, and Blender</i></b> are used to build this project.
<p>I've grown more comfortable using ThreeJs while working on this project,</p>           
<p>and I've begun realizing how much fun I'm having.</p> 
<p>You will find so many mistakes here but this is the first step of my ThreeJs Journey .</p>
